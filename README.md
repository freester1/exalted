# Exalted

A map-reduce implementation for mnesia tables using GenServers. Tries to be as efficient as possibly by spawning workers to perform the map and reduce operations in parallel. All while iterating over the entire mnesia table while it's in memory.


Usage and Benchmarks:

Given a table:
```
:mnesia.create_schema([node()])
:mnesia.start()

:mnesia.create_table(:Product, [
  attributes: [:id, :name, :price],
  type: :ordered_set,
  disc_copies: [node()]])

Populate with 500,000 random entries ...
```
Define a map function `mnesia_record -> value`
```
iex(3)>     map_fun = fn (record) ->
...(3)>       tup = hd(record)
...(3)>       elem(tup, 3)
...(3)>     end
```
Define a reduce function `list of mnesia_records -> value`
```
iex(4)>     reduce_fun = fn (list_of_list_of_records) ->
...(4)>       list_of_list_of_records
...(4)>       |> Enum.reduce(0, fn (r, acc) ->
...(4)>         tup = hd(r)
...(4)>         price = elem(tup, 3)
...(4)>         acc = acc + price
...(4)>       end)
...(4)>     end
```

time(ms) to do a map, then a reduce on an entire table:
```
iex(12)> {time, res} = :timer.tc(fn ->  :mnesia.transaction( fn -> :mnesia.all_keys(:Product) |> Enum.map(fn (key) -> map_fun.(:mnesia.read(:Product, key)) end) |> Enum.reduce(fn(x, acc) -> x+acc end) end) end)
{855705, ...}
iex(13)> time
855705
```

time(ms) to run Exalted map-reduce job with batch size of 75:
```
iex(10)> {time, res} = :timer.tc(fn -> Exalted.map_reduce_query(:Product, map_fun, reduce_fun, 100) end)
{696800,...}
iex(11)> time
696800
```
